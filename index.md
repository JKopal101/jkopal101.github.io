<br><br>
I'm James, welcome to my portfolio! I'm passionate about technology and problem-solving, with expertise in Cybersecurity, Linux, Python, and SQL. Self-taught experience in Network Security, Threat Intelligence, Threat Hunting. I specialize in identifying threats, analysing vulerabilities and automating Cybersecurity tasks to ensure systems remain secure and resilient. 
<br><br>

### **Featured Projects**  
Here are some of my key cybersecurity projects:  

- **[Conducting a Security Audit](https://github.com/JKopal101/Conducting-a-Security-Audit)** ‚Äì A security assessment following NIST guidelines.  
- **[Retail Cyber Defence Strategy](https://github.com/JKopal101/Retail-Cyber-Defence-Strategy)** ‚Äì Implementing secure frameworks for retail.  
- **[Detection Lab](https://github.com/JKopal101/Detection-Lab)** ‚Äì SIEM implementation and log analysis.  
<br>

### **Certifications & Courses** 

- **[TCM Security: Security Operations (SOC) 101](https://tcm-sec.com/)**  
  
- **[Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/)**  
  - Comprehensive introduction to cybersecurity concepts, tools, and best practices.  
  - Topics covered: Security architecture, risk management, and cloud security fundamentals.  

- **[BrainStation Cybersecurity Program - Capstone Project](https://brainstation.io/)**  
  - Conducted a NIST-based risk assessment, identifying vulnerabilities in data security and access control.
  - Recommended encryption, MFA, SIEM tools, and Zero Trust Architecture to mitigate risks.
  - Developed an Incident Response Plan (IRP) and security training to enhance resilience.

  <br>

### **Planned Certifications** 

- **CompTIA Security+**, **CompTIA Network+**, **CISSP**  
- **ISO 27001 Lead Implementer**  

My focus is on developing expertise in threat detection, incident response, and security policy implementation while continuing to work towards certifications.

I‚Äôve honed my skills through hands-on projects, certification programs, and real-world experience working with tools like Wireshark, Splunk, Suricata, and Python. As I continue my journey, I aim to contribute to the growing field of Cybersecurity by taking on roles such as Security Analyst and SOC Analyst.
