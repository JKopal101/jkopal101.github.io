### **About Me**
<br>
Hello! I'm **James**, a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about digital security and ethical hacking. My journey started with an interest in **Linux and scripting**, which led me to explore **cybersecurity frameworks, risk management, and security automation**. I continuously expand my knowledge to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.

For me, the transition from Civil Engineering to Cybersecurity is driven by my growing passion for technology and problem-solving in an evolving digital world. 
Iâ€™m drawn to Cybersecurity because I enjoy problem-solving, continuous learning, and making a real impact by securing organizations against evolving cyber risks.

When I pursued Civil Engineering, I was drawn to the idea of building systems that impact communities, but over time, I realized that my interests were shifting toward the technological side, especially in areas like data protection and digital security. 

As I learned more about the increasing threats and challenges in the Cybersecurity space, I found it to be an exciting and dynamic field where I could apply my analytical skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving mindset in a new way, and watching TV shows and reading about Cyber news.

### **My Approach**
<br>
I believe in a **proactive approach** to Cybersecurityâ€”focusing on **threat detection, incident response, and secure system architecture**. My goal is to help organizations strengthen their security posture while continuously learning and evolving in this dynamic field.
