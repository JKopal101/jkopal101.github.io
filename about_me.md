### **About Me**

<br>

<br>
From a young age, I was always fascinated by technology and how things worked. This curiosity led me to explore different areas of IT, from troubleshooting hardware to experimenting with software. However, it was **Cybersecurity** that truly captured my interestâ€”the idea of protecting systems, detecting threats, and staying ahead of attackers.  


As I learned more about the increasing threats and challenges in the Cybersecurity space, I found it to be an exciting and dynamic field where I could apply my analytical skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving mindset in a new way, and watching TV shows and reading about Cyber news. 

<br>

### **My Cybersecurity Journey**
<br>
My path into cybersecurity began with a background in **Civil Engineering**, where I was drawn to systems thinking and solving real-world problems. Over time, my curiosity shifted toward **technology**, especially in areas like **data protection, digital threats, and cyber defense**.

Iâ€™ve since been self-studying, taking courses, and building hands-on labs to develop my technical skills.<br>

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what Iâ€™ve been working on: 
<br><br>
ðŸ”¹ **Network Security** â€“ Monitoring traffic, understanding protocols, and detecting anomalies
ðŸ”¹ **Threat Analysis** â€“ Studying attacker behavior and defensive strategies
ðŸ”¹ **SIEM & Incident Response** â€“ Using tools like Splunk, Security Onion, and Suricata
ðŸ”¹ **Security Automation** â€“ Writing Python scripts to streamline defensive tasks
<br><br>

### **My Goals**  
<br>
I am currently working towards **CompTIA Security+** and continuously improving my skills through real-world projects. My ultimate goal is to become a **SOC Analyst** and contribute to a safer digital world. I am also interested in Pen Testing and enjoy purple teaming, as well as exploring the offensive side through Red Team activities.

ðŸš€ *Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field, and Iâ€™m excited to grow with it!* 


Beyond Cybersecurity, I enjoy **hill walking, snowboarding, boxing, and playing the piano**. I'm always open to collaborating on security-related projects, so feel free to connect!
