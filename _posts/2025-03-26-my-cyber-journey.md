### Where It All Started
<br>
Like many people who switch careers, my journey into Cybersecurity didn’t start in a server room or with a terminal open. I originally studied and my background is in Civil Engineering, solving physical world problems and working on critical infrastructure. In Civil, I was drawn to the idea of building systems that impact communities, but over time, I realized that my interests were shifting toward the technology side, especially in areas like digital security. 
I originally started off trying web development, which I grew to like programming such as Python which gave me an idea for the software side. 
For me, the transition from Civil Engineering to Cybersecurity is driven by my growing passion for technology and problem-solving in an evolving digital world. Computers have always been my thing growing up; from building them to always fixing friends' problems and being the tech guy for my family, fixing anything tech has always got me persistent and curious when something doesn’t work. 

But the puzzle-solving nature of that work sparked a new kind of curiosity—how things work digitally, how systems connect, and more importantly, how they can be broken... and defended.As I learned more about the increasing threats and challenges in the Cybersecurity space, I found it to be an exciting and dynamic field where I could apply my analytical skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving mindset in a new way, and watching TV shows and reading about Cyber news.
Hello and welcome! I’m James, and this blog marks the start of my cybersecurity journey. From a civil engineering background to delving deep into network security and threat detection, this has been an exciting shift, and I want to document it all here — from where it began to where I'm headed.

### 👷‍♂️ Life Before Cyber: Engineering & Construction

Before diving into cybersecurity, I worked as a **Civil, Structural & Architectural Engineer** at Cavendish Nuclear. I was responsible for overseeing engineering changes, ensuring safety and compliance, and collaborating with teams across disciplines.

It was highly technical, but over time, I found myself increasingly drawn to **tech systems**, particularly how they’re built, exploited, and defended.

### 🧪 First Exposure: Playing with Linux & Security Labs

My curiosity led me to:
- Install **Linux (Ubuntu, Kali)** on an old gaming laptop.
- Set up **VirtualBox** for running isolated lab environments.
- Explore platforms like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**.
- Start scripting with **Python** and **Bash**.

I was hooked. The technical depth, the constant problem-solving, and the impact of defending systems all resonated with me.

### 🧠 Building Skills & Community

To stay consistent, I joined a **Cybersecurity Skool community**, which provided mentorship and structure. I learned from professionals with years of experience and started treating my study like a job.

Some tools & topics I’ve explored so far:
- **Security Onion** for network monitoring.
- **Wireshark** and **Tcpdump** for packet analysis.
- **SIEM tools** (like Splunk).
- **AWS** services: EC2, IAM, S3, SNS, CloudTrail.
- **Threat intelligence** frameworks and purple teaming strategies.

### 🔐 SOC & Purple Team Interests

I'm actively preparing for **SOC Analyst** roles and sharpening my detection and analysis skills. At the same time, **Purple Teaming** is pulling me in — I love the idea of blending offensive and defensive thinking.

What excites me about Purple Teaming:
- Seeing both sides of the attack/defense lifecycle.
- Simulating real threats to improve detection.
- Bridging the gap between red and blue teams.

### 📜 Certifications & Career Goals

I'm currently studying for the **CompTIA Security+** certification, which is helping reinforce foundational knowledge in areas like:

- Risk Management
- Network Security
- Identity & Access Management
- Incident Response

**Next Goals**:
- 🧠 Pass Security+
- 🎯 Land a SOC Analyst or Cybersecurity Internship
- 🛠️ Contribute to open-source or threat hunting projects
- 🔭 Continue building my GitHub portfolio: [github.com/jkopal101](https://github.com/jkopal101)

### 🔍 Current Life & Job Hunt

I’ve recently moved to **Calgary**, and while I’m pursuing cybersecurity roles, I’m also open to **labour/construction work** to support myself while learning.

I’ve even created a custom **Cyber Job Tracker** using Google Sheets to manage applications, track roles by domain (SOC, GRC, Purple Team, etc.), and prioritize high-impact job posts.

### 🚀 Final Thoughts

Cybersecurity feels like a calling — the perfect combination of technical depth, constant learning, and real-world impact. I’ll continue sharing insights, struggles, and wins here.

Cybersecurity is more than a career path for me—it’s a calling. The mix of constant learning, problem-solving, and mission-driven work is exactly what I was searching for. A mix of programming and digital security makes it a great domain for me.
